Photo App plugin for XBMC
=========================
This plugin shows an Apple Photo App library in XBMC.  After reading the library database,
you will see categories that correspond with their application counterparts:

* Moments
* Albums / Events
* Sildeshows

Your photo library must be reachable over the filesystem from the machine on which you
run XBMC.


Configuration
=============
The plugin needs to know where your Photo Library file is.  If you haven't
explicitly pointed iPhoto to a non-standard library location, the default 
("~/Pictures/Fotos Library.photoslibrary" will be used, but this is probably not working
in all cases. In this case, please enter in the correct path in the plugin's settings
dialog.
